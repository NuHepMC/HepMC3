3.0.0a1
=======

* HepMC3 file reader

* Provide an empty libHepMCfio library

* Hide headers only intended for internal use

* Eliminate static setup class if we can -- what is the need?
  TP: We have some global options that user may want to change.
      They need to be kept somewhere.

* Change namespace, lib name, etc. to HepMC for build system compat
  TP: Do we prepare a script for user that does this or do we change
      them permanently?

* See also: http://hepmc.web.cern.ch/hepmc/todo.html
  and:      https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/HEPMC

NOTE: Do we really need this TODO file if we have JIRA and doxygen?
      Do we also need ChangeLog, for the same reason? Shouldn't ChangeLog
      document only release-related changes?
