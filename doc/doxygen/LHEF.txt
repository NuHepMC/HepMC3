    @defgroup LHEF LHEF - Handling Les Houches Event Files

    This module contains helper classes and Reader and Writer classes
    for handling Les Houches event files - LHEF.

    @section lhef_intro Introduction

    The Les Houches accord on an event file format (LHEF) to be used
    for passing events from a matrix element generator program (MEG)
    to an event generator program (EG) implementing parton showers,
    underlying event models, and hadronisation models etc., was not
    originally included in the HepMC event record format. But as the
    demand for more information to be included in HepMC, it was
    decided to allow HepMC to include also the original information
    from a MEG in the LHEF format (see the run attribute
    HepMC::HEPRUPAttribute and event attribute
    HepMC::HEPEUPAttribute). A separate /standard/ implementation in
    C++ of the LHEF format had already been maintained by Leif
    LÃ¶nnblad, and it was decided to include this (header only -
    LHEF.h) as a part of HepMC. This will both be used in above
    mentioned HepHC::Attribute classes and as a kind of definition of
    the LHEF format, which so far has not been extremely well
    documented. From now on these pages will serve as the defining
    information about the LHEF format.

    @section lhef_background Background

    The original Les Houches accord for communicating between MEGs and
    EGs was agreed upon in
    2001 <a href="http://archive.org/abs/hep-ph/0109068">
    [arXiv:hep-ph/0109068]</a> and consisted of two simple FORTRAN
    common blocks. In fact this structure survived in the LHEF format,
    which was introduced in
    2006 <a href="http://archive.org/abs/hep-ph/0609017">
    [arXiv:hep-ph/0609017]</a>, and is still there after the updated
    versions 2 in 2009 <a href="http://archive.org/abs/1003.1643">
    [arXiv:1003.1643]</a>, and 3 in
    2013 <a href="http://archive.org/abs/1405.1067">
    [arXiv:1405.1067]</a>, and in the current proposal developed at
    the Les Houches workshop on TeV Colliders 2015 <a href=""></a>.

    As the methods for combining MEGs and EGs has advanced since the
    first accord, from the tree-level merging methods and NLO matching
    at the turn of the millennium, to the multi-jet (N)NLO matching
    and merging methods being perfeted to day, the LHEF format has
    developed and a lot of optional information can be passed beyond
    the original common block structures. In the following all
    features included will be described, also those that were added a
    bit prematurely and later became deprecated.

    @section lhef_basics The basic structure

    The LHEF format is based on XML, but has some oddities that goes
    beyond pure XML. As the name indicates, XML is extensible, and
    anyone writing a LHEF file can add whatever information she or he
    wants, however the following basic stucture must be observed.

    @code
    <LesHouchesEvents version="1.0">
      <!--
        # optional information in completely free format,
        # except for the reserved end tag (see next line)
      -->
      <header>
        <!-- individually designed XML tags, in fancy XML style -->
      </header>
      <init>
        compulsory initialization information
        # optional initialization information
      </init>
      <event>                            
         compulsory event information       
         # optional event information       
      </event>                           
      <event>
        compulsory event information
         <!-- more optional information --> 
      </event>
      <!-- and as many events that you want, but ending with -->
    </LesHouchesEvents>
    @endcode 

    This looks like fairly normal XML tags, and indeed they are. The
    only addition to the structure is that the <tt>init</tt> and
    <tt>event</tt> (and their respective end tags) are required to be
    alon on a line, and the content of these blocks are required to
    start with a number of lines on a specific format:
